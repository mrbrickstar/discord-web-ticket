4. Run the script with `node index.js`

# Configure the Tool
To customize the tool to your brand or server, follow this steps

1. Replace every `localhost` in the code through your domain (e.g. http://localhost/ through https://myserver.com)
2. Replace the Logo and the header of the ticket (which is nice.html(don't ask why I named this nice.html)) through your Brand- or Server name
3. Replace the logo and the heading of the ticket page
